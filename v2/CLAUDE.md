## Comments

- Never just narrate the what or how of the code.
- When a comment is warranted, explain the why or motivation, succinctly.
- The bar for adding a comment: large ambiguity, or a design choice that
  would surprise the reader.
- No docstring boilerplate explaining function args, return values, etc.
- Do narrate "gotchas".
- For libraries, consider a file-level extended comment explaining how to
  use the module, with an example.
- In examples, illustrate the API generically. Concrete, evocative names
  are good (`users`, `posts`, `author`). Don't reference specific
  consumers, components, or features elsewhere in this project; the
  example should stand on its own.
- Project-internal references are fine (and often useful) in "why"
  comments; that's where the coupling actually lives.

## Tests

- Refrain from very micro-unit tests; make each test really count.
- Prefer fakes over mocks.
- Lean toward integrated tests written as unit tests.
- Some files may legitimately have few or no tests.

## Architecture

- Pay special attention to the "telos" of a module, file, class, struct,
  function, etc. The Telos, the purpose that is, is the guiding north star
  of what belongs there and what doesn't. What should "know" about what?
- If a fundamental interface cannot be optimized without completely
  changing the interface or Telos, then its the wrong interface. We don't
  have to do the optimization right away, but it needs to be the right
  shape to do it under.
- Exposing implementation details is inevitable in many cases, like a
  field being a Vec or so forth. Coupling Telos or Knowledge is the thing
  to flag.
- Telos governs data shape; YAGNI governs API surface. Get the shape
  right now (where data lives, who owns what), but only implement the
  methods a real caller needs. The check: would a plausible future need
  force restructuring the data, or just adding a method? If restructure,
  the shape is wrong.
- As we build, flag architecture issues and concerns early and not later.
- Pre-mature abstraction is very deadly to architecture just as pre-mature
  optimization is deadly to benchmarking.

## Rust

- `mod.rs` should only contain `mod` declarations and `pub use`
  re-exports — no logic or implementation.
- Don't add re-exports speculatively in `mod.rs`; wait until a
  caller actually needs it.
